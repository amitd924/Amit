How to Setup Eclipse

Eclipse: (Neon)
The Eclipse download requires about 250 MB of disk space; keep it on your machine, in case you need to re-install Eclipse. When installed, Eclipse requires an additional 250 MB of disk space.

Click Eclipse
The following page will appear in your browser. In this handout we will download Eclipse IDE for Eclipse Committers for Windows 32 Bit; if your computer uses Windows, continue below; otherwise choose either Mac Cocoa or Linux instead.

It is critical that Java, Python, and Eclipse are either all 32 Bit or are all 64 Bit (and only if your Machine/OS supports 64 Bit): I think it easiest to use 32 Bit for everything.

Click the 32-Bit (after Windows) to the right of the Eclipse IDE for Eclipse Committers.
You will see the following page (don't worry about the name of the institution underneath the orange DOWNLOAD button).
